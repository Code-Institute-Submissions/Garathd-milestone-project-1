# Led Zeppelin Band Page

This website is designed to show case the music and videos of Led Zeppelin.  Fans are able to purchase concert tickets as well as listen to some of Led Zeppelin’s greatest hits and purchase some of their most popular albums. Fans can also contact Led Zeppelin in order to request performances at events and parties

## UX

My UX process was to analyze the customers (Led Zeppelin’s) requirements and try and think of different ways to incorporate this into not only just a website but a website that is user friendly and easy to navigate.  

The customer’s requirements are: 

- For their fans to be able to hear clips from their back catalogue and potentially new material
- To showcase their music and publicise their ability to perform at various functions
-	To incorporate pictures of the band into the website
-	Include audio and video clips
-	Create Social Media Links

Following on from this is what Led Zeppelin’s fan base want from their website experience below is a list of user stories.

-	As a fan, I want to be able to follow Led Zeppelin on Social Media
-	As a fan, I want to be able to buy tickets to concerts
-	As a fan , I want to be able to listen to their music and watch their videos
-	As a fan, I want to be able to contact Led Zeppelin

For my research I looked at various design trends and I thought I would go through one of my Wordpress websites and check out the latest themes and what was the most widely used and most popular layouts not just for music related websites but for every type of website. You never know what might inspire you. I also looked at what Metallica was doing and I really liked the way they used a lot of call to action sections in their website. 
Once I found 5 websites I liked or at least parts of the websites I liked I used Photoshop to draw up my website. I was aided in this process using gridlines in order to keep everything straight. The sketches were relatively quick as I know which way I wanted the website to look and knew my design would be both appealing to both the customer and the user. The sketches can be found in the mock-ups folder.

Technologies Used

The technologies used in this project are HTML, CSS and JQuery and using the Bootstrap framework.  
I’m using Bootstrap to create a website that is responsive and clean as it has good inbuilt functionality that makes designing websites easier and quicker.
I’m using JQuery for the contact form in order to clean the textfields upon form completion and also to scroll to top of the page for the button I have located in the footer. I find using regular html anchor tags sometimes problematic and not accurate so I choose this solution as it is consistent and smooth.

## Testing

This website was tested in Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge as well as a Samsung Galaxy S5 and HTC Desire 530. For both mobile phones it was tested a lot in both portrait and landscape screen displays to make sure everything was responsive and displayed correctly anything that gave me any problems I used a few media queries to fix any issues and tested again. Using the 3 Desktop browsers I also constantly changed the width and height of the browser to see if everything was displayed correctly. 
When creating the audio files I initially had an issue with all the songs playing automatically when I navigated to the page. I was initially using Iframes and even setting the auto play to false or 0 it still played automatically. After a lot of research I discovered I can use html5 <audio> and this ended up working perfectly.

A recent issue I’m still trying to figure out is the contact form. The way I have it designed at this moment in time is when a user fills out the form and press send it brings up a bootstrap modal window to say the email was sent. The issue I’m having is with validation if I set the send button to button=”submit” it prompts me that the required fields need to be filled in but when I press send then the modal appears regardless of whether the form has been validated or not. I was thinking of using either PHP or Angular to sort this out as this has worked for me in previous projects but I think this might be overkill and I don’t really want to use any more different technologies than I have to, so I’m trying to come up with a simpler way to achieve this or at the very most use JQuery which I have used already. 

## Deployment

No information as of yet.....


## Content

My Content for the about section was inspired by the Led Zeppelin Wikipedia page and I just took what was there and changed it into my own words.

## Media

The photos used in this site were all good from Google.  I had to use a bit of Photoshop to modify the pictures to work with the site. 

## Acknowledgements

I received inspiration for this website from various wordpress themes and templates as well as the Metallica.com website.
